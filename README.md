# stl-parser

This is a simplified STL file parser.

Note: The development toolchain for this project is a little out of date, but functional. It was based off of https://github.com/jeremyckahn/node-cli-boilerplate.

## Getting started

Clone and install this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:jeremyckahn/stl-parser.git
cd stl-parser
npm install
```

## Usage

You can provide any valid STL text file to this CLI tool, but you can easily test it out with the included `lib/fixtures/moon.stl` file:

```
$: npm run exec -- lib/fixtures/moon.stl
```

## License
